# Capstone Project

## Abstract:

* Our project aims to supercharge recommendation systems, those helpful
tools that guide users to the best choices in an overwhelming digital
world. We're diving deep into technology to enhance these systems.
We're leveraging the incredible power of Deep Learning, a cutting-edge
technique in artificial intelligence.

* With Deep Learning, our recommendation system becomes smarter and
more accurate. It learns from user behaviours and preferences, finetuning suggestions with each interaction.
In summary, our project is all about using Deep Learning to make
recommendation systems more intelligent and user-focused, providing
tailored recommendations that users will love.


## Introduction:

* With the emergence of new technologies and the rapid development of
the Internet, the world is turning into an electronic world, mostly
digitized and accessible with the click of a mouse. E-commerce has
become a major factor changing the way people purchase goods and
services.

* The use of recommendation system is increasing day by day because it is
easy and reliable, and customers can shop online and find the best
option. This system are software tools designed to generate and provide
recommendations for products or content that a specific user would like
to purchase or engage with. Recommendations will specifically identify
available products, focusing on the visual similarity between the product,
and we are creating a method that only suggest the related product to the
customer.

* Our paper deals with the implementation of an e-commerce application
for the sale of different types of products categorized under similar
features. Deep Learning technique is implemented using visual
similarities with help of VGG Model and cosin similarity, for providing
most similar items related to the user's product choices.

* The VGG (Visual Geometry Group) model is a convolutional neural
network (CNN) architecture that has been widely used for image
classification tasks. In this project we are using VGG to extract the
feature of the images. Th key characteristics of the VGG model are its
simplicity and uniformity. It consists of several convolutional layers,
each followed by a max-pooling layer, and it uses small 3x3
convolutional filters throughout the architecture. By using cosine
similarity our model is comparing the feature matrix of the images and
giving us final result.


## Problem Statement:

* In the digital age, the e-commerce landscape has transformed into a
digital world that can be accessed by just clicking there. E-commerce is
influencing consumer behaviour, but the process of searching for and
selecting products is still difficult and time-consuming. 

* Recommendations have become an important solution that provides
convenience and reliability. The project addresses the need for effective
product discovery by developing e-commerce applications using deep
learning techniques. The real challenge is to make the product look
better and more personal and simplify the user experience. This research
is designed to create a system that can understand customers' individual
preferences and simplify recommendations through deep learning to
arrive at accurate content awareness recommendations, ultimately
revolutionizing online business.

## Project Objective:

* Our main aim for this project is to improve our product
recommendations using advanced deep learning techniques. Imagine
having a personal shopping assistant who truly understands your likes
and dislikes, just like a close friend who knows your style perfectly. This
is what we want to achieve: providing you with clear and tailored advice
that feels like we can predict your preferences. Our ultimate goal is to
make your entire shopping journey more exciting, enjoyable, and
satisfying.

* We'll know we've succeeded when you effortlessly find what
you're looking for, Even We want you to be delighted with your
purchases and your overall experience with us.

## Business Application:

* We're enhancing your shopping experience with advanced features.
Easily discover products that match your interests and preferences.
Receive personalized recommendations based on your browsing history,
and find similar items to what you like. Enjoy money-saving suggestions
with discounts and coupons. Explore top-rated products based on
reviews and ratings from other shoppers. Plus, benefit from tailored
marketing and advertising plans. Shopping has never been this
convenient and enjoyable.
